# book website 

# 1. About:
This is the very first project of mine in react application. The idea of the website is to share the titles,authors and ratings of the books read.
The scope was also to understand the strucutre of the react app.

# 2. Architecture:
- javascript
- html
- css

# 3. Development:
To run the project locally follow the steps:
- install node.js and Node Package Manager
- create a new react app running npx create-react-app my-app in a terminal of source-code editor (eg. Visual Studio Code)
- the command will create a new folder named my-app with all the necessary files and folders for a basic React app
- exchange in the directory the files from Book-website repository
- run npm start run command in terminal it will load the app locally

Other way to load the app is via CodeSandbox:
- to open a new react app, type react.new in website
- exchange the existing files with the one from the repository (index.css, index.js,index.html). In order to load the app correctly, load into the page also photos folder
